# IFT6759 - Door Number Detection Project [Advanced projects in machine learning]
IFT6759 is a course about implementing deep learning theory to real-world industrial projects.


## Door Number Detection Project
The goal of this project is to help blind persons to find their way around by making sure they are at the right house when they want for example visit a friend or a family member, go to a specific store, etc.

In developing this project we must keep in mind the different constraints of this application notably for the selection and development of the models we will use like the execution time, online vs. offline, the memory usage (in the case of a mobile application), etc.

### Datset used
